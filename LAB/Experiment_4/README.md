# List-Based vs Generator-Based Processing

## 1. Algorithm / Procedure

1. Create a large dataset.
2. Process it using a **list**.
3. Process the same data using a **generator**.
4. Compare their execution time and memory usage.
5. Display the results.

## 2. Very Simple Python Code

```python
import time
import sys

n = 1000000

# List processing
start = time.time()

data = [x * 2 for x in range(n)]

list_time = time.time() - start
list_memory = sys.getsizeof(data)


# Generator processing
start = time.time()

data = (x * 2 for x in range(n))

for x in data:
    pass

generator_time = time.time() - start
generator_memory = sys.getsizeof(data)


print("List time:", list_time)
print("List memory:", list_memory)

print("Generator time:", generator_time)
print("Generator memory:", generator_memory)
```

## 3. Input

```text
Dataset size: 1,000,000
```

## 4. Output

Example output:

```text
List time: 0.08
List memory: 8448728

Generator time: 0.09
Generator memory: 200
```

*The exact execution time may vary depending on the computer.*

## 5. Inference

A **list uses more memory** because it stores all elements. A **generator uses very little memory** because it produces elements one at a time.

## 6. Analysis

| Method    | Memory   | Execution              |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| List      | High     | Usually faster         |
| Generator | Very low | May be slightly slower |

For large datasets, **generators are more memory efficient** because they process data one item at a time.
