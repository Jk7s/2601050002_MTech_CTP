Sure — here is a **very simple lab-friendly version** with type hints, inheritance, and abstraction.

## 1. Algorithm / Procedure

1. Create an abstract `BankAccount` class.
2. Create `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` as child classes.
3. Use inheritance to get common methods.
4. Use an abstract `withdraw()` method.
5. Deposit and withdraw money.
6. Display the balance.

## 2. Very Simple Python Code

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class BankAccount(ABC):

    def __init__(self, name: str, balance: int) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> None:
        self.balance += amount

    @abstractmethod
    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> None:
        pass

    def show(self) -> None:
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Balance:", self.balance)


class SavingsAccount(BankAccount):

    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> None:
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance")


class CurrentAccount(BankAccount):

    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> None:
        self.balance -= amount


s = SavingsAccount("Suma", 5000)

s.deposit(1000)
s.withdraw(2000)
s.show()


c = CurrentAccount("Tabu", 5000)

c.deposit(1000)
c.withdraw(3000)
c.show()
```

## 3. Input and Output

**Output:**

```text
Name: Suma
Balance: 4000
Name: Tabu
Balance: 3000
```

## 4. Inference

The program demonstrates **abstraction and inheritance** using a simple banking system.

## 5. Analysis

`BankAccount` is the abstract parent class. `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` inherit from it and provide their own `withdraw()` method. **Time complexity: O(1)** and **space complexity: O(1)**.
